## Thanks for visiting! I'm Ryan ðŸ›°
### About
I'm an undergraduate student and tutor at the University of Queensland, studying/teaching astrophysics and science. 
I've developed course materials for UQ's astrophysics program, including a [simulated universe program](https://ryanwhite1.github.io/Simulated-Universe/) written in Python! 

Currently, I'm working on a research project quantifying time dilation in distant supernova lightcurves ðŸŒž but you'll have to trust me since the code is private!
