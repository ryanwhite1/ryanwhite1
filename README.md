## Thanks for visiting! I'm Ryan ðŸ›°
### About
I'm an honours student and tutor at the University of Queensland, studying/teaching astrophysics and science. 
I've developed course materials for UQ's astrophysics program, including a [simulated universe program](https://ryanwhite1.github.io/Simulated-Universe/) written in Python! 

Currently I'm working on research projects quantifying time dilation in distant supernova lightcurves ðŸŒž using the Dark Energy Survey, the migration of stellar-mass black holes and subsequent mergers in active galactic nuclei using Rebound, and the births and deaths of Wolf-Rayet binaries.
