## Thanks for visiting! I'm Ryan ðŸ›°
### About
I'm a masters student and tutor at Macquarie University (Sydney, Aus), studying/teaching astrophysics and science. 
I've developed course materials for the University of Queensland's astrophysics program, including a [simulated universe program](https://ryanwhite1.github.io/Simulated-Universe/) written in Python! 

Currently I'm working on modelling the colliding wind nebulae of massive stars using my own fast and differentiable model built with JAX. Take a look at it [here!](https://github.com/ryanwhite1/xenomorph) (There are pretty pictures)
